# Lavender Hollow
![Lavender Hollow cover image, showing the protagonist, Ghasty, looking out over a field of Lavender.](https://github.com/shadybug/lavender-hollow/blob/master/lavender.png?raw=true)
A game about helping ghosts heal. [Play it on itch.io](https://shadybug.itch.io/lavender-hollow)!

This repository is a really big WIP, I didn't organize a lot of things as I was coding. But all the code itself is commented!

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line at @CicadaGhost on Twitter.
